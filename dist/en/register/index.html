				<h3>Creating secure passwords isn't hard.</h3>
				<p>It's easy once you understand how passwords are broken. Services actually store a <i>fingerprint</i> that
					can only be created using your password. Attackers try to guess your password until they can create the
					same fingerprint, that's when they know they guessed correctly.</p>
				<p>To make guessing easier, they try common passwords, mixed with common alterations like numbers and symbols
					in position's you're likely to choose. An example would be <i>Password1!</i>.</p>
				<p>We can make guessing harder by choosing passwords with numbers and special characters that are not at
					the end of the password, and by avoiding words found in a dictionary.</p>
				<p>To help you with remembering those passwords, you could use one of many free password managers or
					use methods designed to aid your memory. An example:</p>
				<p>Create a sentence containing numbers and punctuation. For our example, we'll choose</p>
				<p><b>I like walking my 2 dogs, they always play fetch with me and my friends!</b></p>
				<p>Then we take the first character or the first few characters of every word and take every number and
					punctuation, and create our new password from that:</p>
				<p><b>Ilwm2d,tapfwmamf!</b></p>
				<p>There we have our password, it's long and hard to guess, but as long as we remember the sentence,
					we will be able to derive the password again. We could of course improve it by using more capital letters
					and uncommon punctuation.</p>
				<p>Get creative! Make your passwords hard to guess and easy to remember, and seriously think about using
					a password manager to keep track of your logins. Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
